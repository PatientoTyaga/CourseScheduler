Iteration 2 Worksheet
=====================
Adding Feature
-----------------

Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project:

We had originally planned to implement save schedule feature but due to the constraints we had due to the fake database
we decided to instead implement the add course feature since this feature only requires us to save the courses at the point 
in time when it is being used.

Provide links to the feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit
that was used complete the feature:

Agile Planning
--------------
We initially had the plan to start with and create the "save schedule" feature but had to change the plan and instead implemented the add schedule feature. Since we didn't have
proper sql database. We had to make a fake database and utilize its information to store the courses that the student selected.We stored that information inside an arraylist that would be 
cleared out upon refreshing or selecting a new student every single time. This way we don't need to worry about retrieving informaiton from the database for a particular student
atleast at this stage of our project. 

Added new feature - Add course.

Pushed Feature to iteration 2 - Save schedule
Link for save schedule: https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/coursescheduler-comp3350-a03-group9/-/issues/1

We changed the description for the Add course user story and the Add course Feature

RETROSPECTIVE
-------------
Overall, the group as a whole working really well together to accomplish shared goals. However there are plenty of areas that we can improve to make 
our development process even smoother. Therefore, the team communicates well with one another and have good organization of iterations and task. 
One problem that we fixed from iteration 1, for example having different branches assigned with specific issues along with the designated task. So 
that we can all show our distribution in the project and keep a record of it. 

For instances, one of the group members opened an issue for refactoring the codes, Links:
Me, myself oneped an issue for () Links:

All of them are labelled as 'High Priority' and 'To Do' since we all need to work on this right now. The branches and issues help other members to see where 
you at and do help if required.

We have # features for Iteration 2:
1) Save Course to Schedule
2) Delete Course to Schedule
3) Resolve Course Conflict

Created several issues for the feastures and assigned them
Links: 

Fortunately, we are able to get the Database working and able to display the Database entries on the UI.
Links: 

Working on the updated Architecture as discussed with the professor.
Links:

Updating the UI in UI branch, add a new button in LoginActivityL page. Once we click it, we can go to 
Login Activity to load Student Information in Database. 

Our main concern is to get the app to work first then do the functionality.
