Course Scheduler app will be used to help students plan their schedule and simplify course slot selection. 
This system will be designed primarily for University of Manitoba students, but also might be used by student advisors. Main part of the app will be used only once a year during registration period, but other features such as notifications for classes or emailing a professor might make the app more useful.
Since this app won’t be used for registering for the courses itself, but only to see the sections a course offers, there would be not a lot of security implemented for this app. Students might want to create an account where they will add courses that they have already taken and passed, so there would be an option not to display some courses if a student doesn’t satisfy prerequisites for it.
The whole process of making the schedule will be much simplified. With Aurora system, student had to keep a tab open for every course they want to register in and then compare available sections going through every tab. Our course scheduler app will eliminate most of the problems student has to face when registering for courses. It will keep all important and useful information on one screen. It will be easier to manipulate the time slots, and after the user is done creating the schedule for both terms, they just need to copy CRN numbers for those courses from the app and insert them in Aurora.
This app will be considered successful if more than 50% of surveyed students would decide to use it to make schedules for the rest of their education. And the time it takes a student to choose courses for both terms in such a way, that they don’t interfere with each other, is reduced by 50%.
