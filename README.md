# Course Scheduler Vision Statement

Course Scheduler app will permit students to plan their schedule and simplify course slot selection. 
The app will output a calendar like UM Aurora’s ‘Week at a Glance’ that would allow the user to view their schedule for the desired courses before registering for them. 
The user can save multiple schedules based on different time slots that a course offers and allow them to plan accordingly.

This system is designed primarily for University of Manitoba students, but also might be used by student advisors. 
The app will be used by students during their course registration period to help them plan their courses. 
Other faculty members such as student advisors can use the system to plan out schedules for students seeking advise for their course planning. 

The app will permit user to input course information such as available terms, time slots, CRN numbers and instructor name. 
The app will process all possible combinations for the schedules from the provided input and allow the user to select the preferred schedule. 
Users can also edit a schedule’s time slots, available term, or instructor name to generate a modified schedule.

Since the system will be used by all levels of users to view the possible schedules for the desired courses, there is no necessity for a security implementation. 
The system is not for registering courses, so the system does not need to recognize the dependencies of course prerequisites. 
It needs to maintain a record of different course schedules with its corresponding information such as term, time slot, CRN number and instructor name.

The system is envisioned as an android application but can be modified in future to be released on multiple platforms. 
Future improvements such as keeping a record of the different courses and prerequisite information can allow the application to be widely used and be more user friendly.

The system will significantly improve the process of planning course loads for students. 
There is currently no system for students to preplan their courses. 
With Aurora system, students must keep a tab open for each course they want to register in and then compare available sections by going through every tab. 
Our course scheduler app will eliminate the problem by displaying all the necessary information on one screen. 
It will be easier for the user to alter the input values and create schedules. 
After the user is done creating the schedules for both terms, they just need to copy CRN numbers for those courses sections from the app and insert them in Aurora to register.

This app will be considered successful if more than 50% of surveyed students would decide to use it to make schedules for the rest of their education.
