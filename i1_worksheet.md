Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================
Add Course
-----------------

Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project:

We had originally planned to implement save schedule feature but due to the constraints we had due to the fake database
we decided to instead implement the add course feature since this feature only requires us to save the courses at the point 
in time when it is being used.

Provide links to the feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit
that was used complete the feature:

Use one or two paragraphs which can have point-form within them.

Agile Planning
--------------
We initially had the plan to start with and create the "save schedule" feature but had to change the plan and instead implemented the add schedule feature. Since we didn't have
proper sql database. We had to make a fake database and utilize its information to store the courses that the student selected.We stored that information inside an arraylist that would be 
cleared out upon refreshing or selecting a new student every single time. This way we don't need to worry about retrieving informaiton from the database for a particular student
atleast at this stage of our project. 

Added new feature - Add course.
